# maidsafe-test

This is my attempt to deal with [SAFE Network](https://maidsafe.net).

Serve contents of the directory locally using your favorite server. You can use the serve_static.js script with NodeJs. Direct the [Maidsafe Browser](https://forum.safedev.org/t/how-to-develop-for-the-safe-network-draft/843) to localhost://p:8400/test.html (change the port after "p:" accordingly to your local web server).

You will be asked to authorize this test app to user Safe Network. "Save" button saves a new entry to your home container. "Read" button reads your home container from networ and logs it to the console as a simple object.

Compatible with [0.3.0 version of API](http://docs.maidsafe.net/beaker-plugin-safe-app/) (alpha2 network).
